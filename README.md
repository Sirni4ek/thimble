## Key Benefits

* **Security:** End-to-end encryption ensures your messages remain confidential.
* **Reliability:** Message history is stored in a Git repository for easy auditing and backup.
* **Efficiency:** A streamlined interface helps you communicate quickly and effectively.

## Why Thimble?

Thimble fills a unique niche. It's perfect for situations where secure, trackable messaging is essential, 
but where the full features of a traditional email client aren't necessary.

## Getting Started

The messages are stored in text files under the message directory, under message/yyyy-mm-dd/filename.txt.

To store a new message, write a new file. (Interface coming soon!)

To start local server, use one of the following:

```bash start_server.sh```

```php start_server.php```

```python3 start_server.py```

```ruby start_server.rb```

To add new files:

```node commit_files.js```

```php commit_files.php```

```python3 commit_files.py```

The listing page can be generated by one of these:

```node generate_report.js```

```php generate_report.php```

```python3 generate_report.py```

```bash generate_report.sh```
